    cropName: "Tomato",
    description:
      "Tomato is highly vulnerable to viral curl and mosaic infections, especially during early growth. Regular application improves leaf strength, flower formation, and overall fruit quality for better market output.",
    cycleFrequency: "Every 10–12 days",
    bestStageToUse: "Early vegetative stage + flowering",
    expectedBenefit: "Helps prevent curl, mosaic & improves fruit set",
  },
  {
    icon: "/cherry.png",
    cropName: "Chilli",
    description:
      "Chilli plants show early signs of mosaic and curling. Timely usage protects young growth, helps leaf expansion, and improves plant health through the critical fruiting stage.",
    cycleFrequency: "Every 8–10 days",
    bestStageToUse: "At 2–3 leaf stage or early symptoms",
    expectedBenefit: "Controls early mosaic and supports leaf expansion",
  },
  {
    icon: "/plant.png",
    cropName: "Papaya",
    description:
      "Papaya often suffers mosaic and curling that slow down growth. Regular application promotes fresh green leaves, improves chlorophyll levels, and restores plant vigor with visible shoot recovery.",
    cycleFrequency: "Every 12–15 days",
    bestStageToUse: "During leaf yellowing / curling",
    expectedBenefit: "Promotes new shoot growth & improves vigor",
  },
  {
    icon: "/leaf3.png",
    cropName: "Watermelon",
    description:
      "Watermelon responds best when treated before flowering. It improves vine strength, reduces stress, and results in better fruit setting, size, and sweetness over flowering cycles.",
    cycleFrequency: "10–12 day intervals",
    bestStageToUse: "Pre-flowering to fruiting",
    expectedBenefit: "Strong vines, better fruit development",
  },
  {
    icon: "/grains.png",
    cropName: "Beans",
    description:
      "Beans require stable leaf health for high yield. Regular use deepens leaf color, boosts resilience, and improves branching for denser flower and pod formation.",
    cycleFrequency: "Every 10–12 days",
    bestStageToUse: "Early vegetative & flowering",
    expectedBenefit: "Improves leaf color, stress tolerance, yield",
  },
  {
    icon: "/Flower.png",
    cropName: "Cotton",
    description:
      "Cotton benefits from sustained immunity during vegetative and boll-setting stages. Usage improves boll retention, reduces stress, and increases fiber yield potential.",
    cycleFrequency: "15–20 day intervals",
    bestStageToUse: "Vegetative + boll formation",
    expectedBenefit: "Reduces stress & improves boll retention",
  },
