    title: "Foliar Spray (Primary & Fast Action Method)",
    description:
      "Foliar spray is the quickest and most effective way to deliver nutrients directly through leaf pores. Perfect for correcting nutrient deficiencies or boosting crop immunity during vulnerable growth stages.",
    image: "/step1.png",
    imageAlt: "Farmer applying foliar spray to crops",
    howToUse: [
      "Mix 2–3 ml of product per liter of water",
      "Spray effectively in early morning or late afternoon to avoid leaf burn",
      "Apply every 7–10 days or as needed",
      "Ensure even coverage on both upper and lower leaf surfaces",
      "Use after irrigation to increase effectiveness",
    ],
    whatToExpect: [
      "Stronger root development if soil enriched nutrition",
      "Visible plant growth within 7–10 days",
      "Gradual color change indicating better health",
      "Consistent applications lead to increase yield",
    ],

    stepNumber: 2,
    title: "Soil Drench (Root-Level Strength & Recovery)",
    description:
      "Soil drench is ideal for delivering nutrients and bio-stimulants directly to the root zone. It's particularly effective for strengthening root systems, supporting plant recovery from stress, and improving overall resilience.",
    image: "/step2.png",
    imageAlt: "Farmer watering crops at soil level",
    howToUse: [
      "Mix 5–10 ml per liter of water",
      "Apply around the root zone after irrigation",
      "Repeat every 10–15 days, but avoid over-saturation",
      "Adjust dose based on crop type & soil moisture",
    ],
    whatToExpect: [
      "Stronger root development and soil-enriched nutrition",
      "Better drought tolerance as plants recover faster",
      "Enhanced nutrient uptake from the soil",
      "Increased resistance to root rot and diseases",
    ],

  {
    stepNumber: 3,
    title: "Seed Treatment (Early-Stage Protection)",
    description:
      "Seed coating ensures protection right from germination. This method strengthens crops even before the first leaf appears giving them resistance when they are most vulnerable.",
    image: "/step3.png",
    imageAlt: "Farmer applying foliar spray to crops",
    howToUse: [
      "Mix 2–3 ml per 1 kg of seeds under shade",
      "Coat evenly until seeds appear glossy/moist",
      "Dry lightly for 15–30 minutes before sowing",
      "Apply during moist soil — avoid very dry ground",
      "Works for field sowing, nursery trays & plugs",
    ],
    whatToExpect: [
      "Higher germination percentage + uniform emergence",
      "Healthy root initiation and strong early growth",
      "Lower susceptibility to viral, pest, and fungal stress later",
